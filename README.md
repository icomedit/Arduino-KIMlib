KIMaip KNX / EIB Arduino Library

This design for KNX I2C Interface module KIMaip, it consists of a microcontroller running the certified KNX communication stack KAIstack and the high performance KNX interface to the KNX bus - KAIphys. This design enables direct usage of the high power supply from the bus.

This library is intended to use the module directly to an application controller and is thus optimized as basis for end devices.

You can buy KIMaip KNX / EIB shield for your experiment whit Arduino.
