KIMaip KNX / EIB Arduino Library

This design for KNX I2C Interface module KIMaip, it consists of a microcontroller running the certified KNX communication stack KAIstack and the high performance KNX interface to the KNX bus - KAIphys. This design enables direct usage of the high power supply from the bus.

It is esay to read and wirite KNX comunication object or KNX parameter into KIMaip device.

You can write a program logic with Arduino IDE (C++), next step, you can use ETS for link the KNX object to group address and download application, configuration and address into KIMaip device.

This library is intended to use the module directly to an application controller and is thus optimized as basis for end devices.

You can buy KIMaip KNX / EIB shield for your experiment whit Arduino.
